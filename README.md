# What is this?
Need some scripts to calculate and analyze anthropometric indicators? Look no further! These are scripts that I've created that I find easy to use.

Versions:
- R: 4.3.3

- dplyr: 1.1.4
- ggplot2: 3.4.4

- purrr: 1.0.2
- readr: 2.1.5

# TODO LIST:
- Write a script to take the average of several repeated measurements of weight, height, waist circumference, and hip circumference and then calculate BMI/WHR/WHtR/WWI.
- Write a script to generate histograms.
- Write a script to generate summary statistics.
